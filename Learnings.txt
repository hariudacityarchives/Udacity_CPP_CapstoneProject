1. Created a Window which is usable with OpenGL Context
2. Create a OpenGL context (object ) and Make it the current object
3. Sprite are 2D Bitmap Shapes integrated
    3.1 Using Vertex Data 2d bitmaps are Created
    3.2 Mostly Shapes are drawn using Point in the Window location
            Display Position (-1,1)         (1,1)
                                    (0,0)
                             (-1,-1)        (1,-1)
    3.3 For Drawing a Square 6 Vertex Points are Need (where in each point contains x and y location)

4. Shaders

    Shaders calculate rendering effects on graphics hardware with a high degree of flexibility.

    The position and color (hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast) of all pixels, 
    vertices, and/or textures used to construct a final rendered image can be altered using algorithms defined in a shader, 
    and can be modified by external variables or textures introduced by the computer program calling the shader.

    Rendering or image synthesis is the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic 
    image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a computer program. 
    The resulting image is referred to as the render.
